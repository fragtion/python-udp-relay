# python-udp-relay
Super simple script that listens on a local UDP port and relays all packets to a specified remote host:port.
Packets that the host sends back will also be relayed to the local UDP client.
Works with Python 2 and 3

I've created a discreet repo for this utility because the original project is part of a wider collection of scripts
